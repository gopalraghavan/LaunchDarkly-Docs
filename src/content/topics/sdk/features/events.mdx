## Overview

This topic explains how to send custom events using the track feature in your SDK. The track feature is available on both client-side and server-side SDKs.

## Tracking events

The track feature lets you record actions your users take in your application as events. You can connect these events to metrics in A/B tests or experiments in the LaunchDarkly dashboard.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

### .NET (client-side)

The `Track` method lets you record actions your users take on your site. This lets you record events that take place on your server.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
client.Track("your-goal-key");
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also attach custom data to your event by passing an extra parameter to `Track`, using the `LdValue` class to represent any value that can be encoded in JSON. To learn how, read [`LdClient.Track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/html/M_LaunchDarkly_Xamarin_LdClient_Track_1.htm).

### Android

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take in your application. You can also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an extra `JsonElement` parameter to `track`.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.track("your-goal-key", data);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
client.track("your-goal-key", data)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/android-client-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/android/LDClientInterface.html#track-java.lang.String-).

You can also attach custom data to your event by calling [`TrackData`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/android-client-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/android/LDClientInterface.html#trackData-java.lang.String-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDValue-) or [`TrackMetric`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/android-client-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/android/LDClientInterface.html#trackMetric-java.lang.String-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDValue-double-).

### C/C++ (client-side)

The track method allows you to record custom events in your application with LaunchDarkly:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientTrack(client, "YOUR_EVENT_KEY");
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>


To learn more, read [`LDClientTrack`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/c-client-sdk/client_8h.html#aed07ba2acbb632f26e63c633b0ef5df5).

You can also attach custom data to your event by calling [`LDClientTrackData`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/c-client-sdk/client_8h.html#aa46b7314691b447f514a432c673a54c3) or [`LDClientTrackMetric`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/c-client-sdk/client_8h.html#ab43d4a144c18509986b5e0a2f747cb8b).

### Electron

Evaluating flags, either with `variation()` or with `allFlags()`, produces analytics events which you can observe on your LaunchDarkly Debugger page. The initial user you specify in the client constructor, as well as any user you specify with `identify()`, produces an analytics event which is how LaunchDarkly receives your user data.

You can also explicitly send an event with any data you like using the `track` function:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.track('my-custom-event-key', { customProperty: someValue });
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can completely disable event sending by setting `sendEvents` to `false` in the client options, but be aware that this means you will not have user data on your LaunchDarkly dashboard.

### Flutter

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take in your you do application. You can have also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an extra `LDValue` parameter to `track`.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
await LDClient.track('your-goal-key', data: LDValue.objectBuilder().addBool("clicked-button", true).build());
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>


You can also attach custom data to your event using the [track method](https://launchdarkly.github.io/flutter-client-sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/LDClient/track.html) with optional parameters.

### iOS

In the iOS SDK, track is a custom event added to the LDClient event store. A client app can set a tracking event to allow client customized data analysis. After an app has called `track`, the app cannot remove the event from the event store. LDClient periodically transmits events to LaunchDarkly based on the frequency set in `LDConfig.eventFlushInterval`. The LDClient must be started and online.

After the SDK's event store is full, the SDK discards new events until the event store is cleared when it reports events to LaunchDarkly. Configure the size of the event store using `LDConfig.eventCapacity`. The first parameter, `key`, is the key for the event. The SDK does nothing with the key, which can be any string the client app sends. The second parameter, `data`, is the data for the event. The `data` paraemeter is optional. The SDK does nothing with the data, which can be any valid JSON item the client app sends. If the data is not a valid JSON item, the method throws an `LDInvalidArgumentError`.

Optionally, you can add a `metricValue` parameter of type `Double` to `track` in Swift or as a required paramter to the overloaded `track` method in Objective-C.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
try {
    let data = ["some-custom-key": "some-custom-value", "another-custom-key": 7] as [String: Any]
    try LDClient.get()!.track(key: "MY_TRACK_EVENT_NAME", data: data)
} catch is LDInvalidArgumentError {
    // Do something with the error
} catch {}

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
NSError* err = nil;
[[LDClient get] trackWithKey:@"MY_TRACK_EVENT_NAME" data:@{@"some-custom-key": @"some-custom-value", @"another-custom-key": @7} error: &err];
if (err != nil) {
    // Do something with the error
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with optional parameters, read [Events](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ios-client-sdk/Classes/ObjcLDClient.html#/Events).

### JavaScript

You can record custom events using the `track` function. In LaunchDarkly, you can connect these events to metrics in experiments. To learn more, read [Experimentation](/home/experimentation).

Call `track` with the event name to record custom conversion metrics.

The second argument is optional. It assists with observational analytics for Data Export destinations. With Data Export, the second argument gives additional context without saving the data to the LaunchDarkly user.

To call `track`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.track("your-event-name", { customProperty: someValue });
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with optional parameters, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldclient.html#track).

#### Tracking click and pageview events in JavaScript
---
<br/>

If you've defined click or pageview goals in LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been initialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or pageview goals.

To learn more about click and pageview goals, read [Experimentation](/home/experimentation).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Single-page apps</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK automatically handles URL changes made by the HTML5 history API or by changing the URL hash fragment, and will trigger pageview and click events correctly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

#### Analytics in JavaScript
---

Evaluating flags, either with `variation()` or with `allFlags()`, produces analytics events which you can observe on your LaunchDarkly Debugger page. The initial user you specify in the client constructor, as well as any user you specify with `identify()`, produces an analytics event which is how LaunchDarkly receives your user data.

You can also explicitly send an event with any data you like using the `track` function. The second argument is optional. For example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
ldclient.track("your-event-name", { customProperty: someValue });
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you [define click or pageview metrics](/home/experimentation) in LaunchDarkly, they are sent automatically once the client has been initialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or pageview goals. The SDK will generate pageview events correctly regardless of how the URL is changed, such as by the HTML5 history API, by changing the URL hash fragment, etc.

You can completely disable event sending by setting `sendEvents` to `false` in the client options, but this means you will not have user data on your LaunchDarkly dashboard.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Do Not Track and ad blocking software</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The JavaScript SDK respects the [Do Not Track events](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) header. If an end-user has Do Not Track enabled in their browser, the SDK does not send analytics events for flag evaluations or goals to events.launchdarkly.com. In addition, ad blocking software may block analytics events from being sent. This does not impact feature flag evaluations.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Node.js (client-side)

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take, giving them any event name you want. This lets you record events that take place client-side. The current user data automatically accompany the event.

Here's an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.track("something-happened");

client.track("something-happened-with-custom-data", { someData: 2 });
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with optional parameters, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/node-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_node_client_sdk_.ldclient.html#track).

### React Native

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take in your app. You can also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an extra parameter to `track`.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Availability</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>Since v2.1.0</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Optionally, you can add a `metricValue` parameter to the `track` method if you are using the latest version of Experimentation.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.track('MY_GOAL_FLAG_KEY', false);
client.track('MY_GOAL_FLAG_KEY_WITH_DATA', {'some_data':'value'});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with optional parameters, read [`track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/classes/_launchdarkly_react_native_client_sdk_.ldclient.html#track).

### Roku

The `track` method lets you record custom events in your application with LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
REM without optional data
launchDarkly.track("YOUR_EVENT_KEY")

REM with optional data
launchDarkly.track("YOUR_EVENT_KEY", {"customField": 123})

REM with optional numeric metric
launchDarkly.track("YOUR_EVENT_KEY", invalid, 52.3)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### .NET (server-side)

The [`Track`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_Track_) method lets you record actions users take on your site. This lets you record events that take place on your server. In LaunchDarkly, you can tie these events to goals in A/B tests.

Here's an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: '.NET', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
client.Track("your-goal-key", user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also attach custom data to your event by passing an extra parameter to `Track`. To do this, use the [`LdValue`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.LdValue.html) type, which can contain any kind of data supported by JSON. You can also pass another parameter for a custom metric value.

### Apex

The `track` method lets you record actions your users take in your you do application. You can also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an `LDValue` parameter to `track`, or a custom metric value by passing a `Double` parameter.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Apex', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.track(user, 'your-goal-key', 52.3, LDValue.of('my value'));
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn how to attach custom data to your event with extra parameters, read [Other methods](https://github.com/launchdarkly/apex-server-sdk/blob/master/doc.md#other-methods-1).

### Go

The `Track` methods allow you to record actions your users take on your site. This lets you record events that take place on your server.

In this example, we use [`TrackEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.TrackEvent) to send an event called `completed-purchase`. This event can correspond to a metric with the same key.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
client.TrackEvent("completed-purchase", user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also attach custom data to your event by calling [`TrackData`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.TrackData), which takes an extra parameter. Or, if you are using experimentation, you can specify a numeric metric with [`TrackMetric`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.TrackMetric).

  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.track("your-goal-key", user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also attach custom JSON data to your event with an alternate version of `track`, [`trackData`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/java-server-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDClient.html#trackData-java.lang.String-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDUser-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDValue-).
