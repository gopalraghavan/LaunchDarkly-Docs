## Overview

LaunchDarkly's [Datadog dashboard widget](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/launchdarkly) lets you pin feature flags to your Datadog dashboards to monitor and toggle flags from within Datadog. This allows you to manage feature releases in individual environments while monitoring your application performance, without needing to switch between applications.

You can use the widget to organize, monitor, and toggle your flags on and off. You can filter flags by attributes such as project, environment, or tags. Additionally, you can employ a [Datadog template variable](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/template_variables/) to ensure the contents update with the rest of your Datadog view.

The Datadog dashboard widget uses the same permissions set for an account member's Datadog and LaunchDarkly accounts. When using a shared dashboard, account members can view and edit flags based on their permissions within the LaunchDarkly app.

You cannot toggle feature flags that require approval from within the widget. Instead, you can click on a flag name to open the flag details page within LaunchDarkly and toggle the flag from there.

    * **LaunchDarkly tag filter**: An optional `+` separated list of tags used to filter the feature flags displayed in the widget. If multiple tags are included, only flags that match all included tags will appear. If omitted, all of the project's feature flags will appear.
