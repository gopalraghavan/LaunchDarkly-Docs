## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Dynatrace events integration. The LaunchDarkly Dynatrace events integration makes it easier to diagnose problems by sending flag change events to Dynatrace. Dynatrace can display those events alongside performance graphs, making it easier for Dynatrace users to correlate feature rollouts to changes in operational health.

![A Dynatrace events graph, showing LaunchDarkly flag change events.](dynatrace-dashboard.png)

The integration only sends `flag` actions to Dynatrace. To learn more, read [Feature flag actions](/home/members/role-actions#feature-flags-actions).

To send flag change events to Dynatrace:

1. [Create a Dynatrace API token](#creating-a-dynatrace-api-token)
2. [Configure the Dynatrace integration](#configuring-the-dynatrace-integration)
3. (Optional) [Configure the integration's policy to allow or restrict specific projects and environments](#configuring-integration-policies)
4. [Associate flags with Dynatrace tags](#associating-flags-with-dynatrace-tags)

## Prerequisites

To use the LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integration successfully, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* You must know the URL of your Dynatrace service. Find it by loading your Dynatrace dashboard and looking at the URL in your browser's address bar. For example: `https://csd50042.live.dynatrace.com`. Copy this URL and save it.
* You must have an API token from your Dynatrace account. To learn more, read [Creating a Dynatrace API token](#creating-a-dynatrace-api-token).

## Creating a Dynatrace API token

The Dynatrace API token authenticates the LaunchDarkly integration so it can submit events to your Dynatrace account. To learn more about Dynatrace's API tokens, read [Dynatrace's documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication/).

When you create the token, confirm that the _"Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology"_ option is enabled. This is the only access scope the LaunchDarkly integration needs.

## Configuring the Dynatrace integration

Here's how to add and configure the Dynatrace integration:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and expand the Dynatrace card.
2. Click **Add integration**. The integration configuration screen appears.

![The Dynatrace card, showing the "Add integration" button.](dynatrace-card.png)

3. (Optional) Give your integration a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter your Dynatrace API token.
5. Enter the URL of your Dynatrace service in the **Dynatrace URL** field. Do not include a slash at the end.
6. Select the entity type of the Dynatrace entities you want to send LaunchDarkly events to. To learn more, read [About entity types](#about-entity-types).
7. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which information LaunchDarkly sends to Dynatrace. To learn more, read [Configuring integration policies](#configuring-integration-policies).
8. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
9. Click **Save configuration**.

### About entity types

Dynatrace uses specific entity types for applications within it. For example, if Dynatrace is monitoring your software application and flag change events appear on that Dynatrace's timeline, the application has an entity type such as `SERVICE`, `APPLICATION`, or `PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE`.

To find the application entity type, navigate to the Dynatrace page for the entity and examine the URL. It contains the entity type in capital letters. In this example, the entity type is `PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE`:

![A Dynatrace URL with the entity type called out.](dynatrace-url-app-type-callout.png)

### Configuring integration policies

The "Policy" field lets you control which LaunchDarkly events are sent to Dynatrace. The Resource specifier in the default policy value allows Production environments across all projects to send events:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```text
proj/*:env/production:flag/*
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more about the Resource configuration fields, read [Resources in custom roles](/home/members/role-resources).

You may want to override the default policy for various reasons, including restricting how the integration sees and exports events. Using the policy editor, you can restrict the integration to:

* a specific set of LaunchDarkly projects/environments
* a specific set of flags
* a specific set of actions

For example, to restrict the policy to a single project called `cool-app`, set the policy configuration's Resource field to the following Resource specifier:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```text
proj/cool-app:env/production:flag/*
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The policy above makes it so that the only events the integrations sends to Dynatrace are flag events from the `cool-app` project's Production environment.

If you need to restrict or allow a more complex set of resources than you can specify in a single policy, you might want to add multiple Dynatrace integrations and configure each one to a specific task. Each integration can have its own separate policy configuration.

To learn more about using the policy editor, read [Policies in custom roles](/home/members/role-policies).

## Associating flags with Dynatrace tags

The LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integration only sends events from flags which are explicitly associated with Dynatrace tags. It does **not** send events from every flag in your LaunchDarkly project.

The integration lets you see an application's flag change events beside its performance graphs. This makes it easier to correlate problems with the flag changes that may have caused them.

For this to be most effective, attach a flag's events to all the applications the flag affects, and _only_ those applications.

Associating flags with Dynatrace tags ensures that flag events are attached to the Dynatrace entities which are affected by those events. To learn more about Dynatrace tags, read [Dynatrace's documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/tags-and-metadata/setup/how-to-define-tags/).

To associate a flag with one or more applications using Dynatrace tags:

1. **In Dynatrace:** Create a new tag and add it to each of the applications which depend on the flag. To learn more about creating tags, read [Dynatrace's documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/tags-and-metadata/setup/how-to-define-tags).

![An application page in Dynatrace, with the "my-dynatrace-tag" added.](dynatrace-add-tag.png)

2. **In LaunchDarkly:** Go to the flag's Settings tab.

![The available tabs on a flag page, with Settings highlighted.](dynatrace-flag-tabs.png)

3. Scroll down to the "Custom properties" section and click **Add custom property**.

![The Custom Properties section of a Flag page, shown empty.](flag-settings-custom-properties-empty.png)

4. Enter the name of the tag you created in the "Values" field.
5. In the "Select a property type..." dropdown, select **Dynatrace tags**.

![The Custom Properties section of a Flag page, shown with a Dynatrace tag.](dynatrace-custom-properties-complete.png)

7. Click **Save with comment** to save the custom property.

Now events from your feature flags appear in Dynatrace.

## Troubleshooting

After you configure the LaunchDarkly integration, flag changes appear as events on the Dynatrace event timelines for your applications, or whatever entities you selected.

If an event doesn't appear on Dynatrace after you've changed a flag, you can try the following techniques:

### Wait, then reload the Dynatrace page

Dynatrace can take up to three minutes to register inbound events.

In addition, the **Events** timeline on a Dynatrace page may be frozen to a particular time range, and won't automatically update. Reload the page to update the timeline range.

### Verify that the Dynatrace entities have recently registered traffic or other agent-sourced data

Dynatrace's API only provides access to entities, such as applications, which have recently registered data from Dynatrace Agents. Entities without recent data may be visible in the Dynatrace user interface, but may be unable to register flag changes or other kinds of events.

Verify that Dynatrace OneAgent is running and monitoring the entity, and that the entity is displaying recent traffic data on its Dynatrace page.

### Verify the custom properties of the flag that changed

The LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integration only sends change events for a flag if that flag has a tag association in its custom properties. To learn more, read [Associating flags with Dynatrace tags](#associating-flags-with-dynatrace-tags).

### Ensure that the integration is configured to use the correct entity type

To learn more, read the step about Dynatrace entity types in [Configuring the Dynatrace integration](#configuring-the-dynatrace-integration).
