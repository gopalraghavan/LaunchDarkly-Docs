## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's triggers feature with Dynatrace. For example, you can create an alert in Dynatrace that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag on or off when a predefined or custom Dynatrace event has been triggered.

We recommend specifying a custom Dynatrace alerting profile for your triggers. This ensures that the scope of events that send a webhook to your LaunchDarkly trigger is correct. To learn more about how to create custom alerting profiles, read [Dynatrace's documentation on alerting profiles](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/notifications-and-alerting/alerting-profiles/).

To learn more about how Dynatrace uses triggers, read [Dynatrace's documentation on webhooks](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/integrations/third-party-integrations/problem-notification-systems/webhook-integration/).

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this topic, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* You must have a feature flag with a "Dynatrace" trigger type. To learn how to create one, read [Creating a new flag trigger](/home/feature-workflows/triggers#creating-a-new-flag-trigger).
* You must have access to the trigger's URL. To learn more about accessing trigger URLs, read [Understanding flag triggers' security](/home/feature-workflows/triggers#understanding-flag-triggers-security).
* You must have an existing [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) account.

## Connecting a LaunchDarkly trigger to Dynatrace

In order to configure a LaunchDarkly trigger in Dynatrace, you must perform two steps:
1. Create an [alerting profile](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/notifications-and-alerting/alerting-profiles/) in Dynatrace to determine what Dynatrace events you want associated with your trigger, and
2. Create a webhook in Dynatrace that includes a custom JSON template with your trigger URL and alerting profile specified.

### Creating a custom alerting profile in Dynatrace

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Create a custom alerting profile in Dynatrace to associate with your trigger</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

 We strongly recommend that you use a custom alerting profile. Alerting profiles specify what Dynatrace event or set of events will invoke the webhook. In the absence of a user-specified alerting profile, Dynatrace's default alerting profile sends a webhook to LaunchDarkly for all Dynatrace events.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To configure a custom alerting profile:

1. Log in to Dynatrace.
2. Create a new alerting profile that filters for the specific events you want to be associated with your LaunchDarkly trigger. To learn more, read [Dynatrace's Alerting profiles documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/notifications-and-alerting/alerting-profiles/).
3. Give the alerting profile a human-readable name.
4. Click **Done** in the top right-hand corner of the page.

### Creating a webhook in Dynatrace with a JSON template

To see event details associated with the invocation of a LaunchDarkly trigger, you must configure a JSON template when setting up the webhook in Dynatrace.

To configure the template:

1. Create a new webhook in Dynatrace. To learn how, read [Dynatrace's Webhook integration documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/integrations/third-party-integrations/problem-notification-systems/webhook-integration).
2. Paste the LaunchDarkly trigger URL into the **Webhook URL** field. 
3. Copy this payload into the **Custom payload** field in Dynatrace:


<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json

{
"title":"{ProblemTitle}",
"url": "{ProblemURL}"
}

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You must customize the payload to render LaunchDarkly audit logs correctly</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly uses the payload `title` and `url` fields to create the main body of trigger audit log entries. If you use a different JSON template than the one provided above, you must include the `title` and `url` fields or the trigger will not save useful data about the event in the flag's audit log. The `url` is the URL of your Dynatrace event.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

4. Select your pre-configured alerting profile from the **Alerting profile** dropdown field.
5. Send a test notification in order to save any new webhook configurations or changes.
6. Return to the LaunchDarkly flag settings page and check that the test notification has been received by clicking on the overflow menu on your LaunchDarkly trigger and confirming that the execution count has incremented.
7. Return to Dynatrace and click **Save**.

Your new Dynatrace webhook now triggers flag changes based on the action you specified in LaunchDarkly. 

For more granular problem detection and alerting, you may want to explore static thresholds in Dynatraceâ€™s custom alerting settings. To learn more, read [Dynatrace's Static thresholds documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/static-thresholds).
