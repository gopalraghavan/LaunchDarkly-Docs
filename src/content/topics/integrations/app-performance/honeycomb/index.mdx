## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Honeycomb integrations available, including events and triggers.

## Events

The LaunchDarkly Honeycomb events integration helps you diagnose problems by sending flag events to Honeycomb. Honeycomb displays those events alongside performance graphs so you can correlate feature rollouts with changes in operational health. To learn how, read [Using the Honeycomb events integration](/integrations/honeycomb/events).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Honeycomb. Flag triggers can be used to automate flag behavior. For example, you can create an alert in Honeycomb that uses a trigger to toggle a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Honeycomb](/integrations/honeycomb/triggers).
