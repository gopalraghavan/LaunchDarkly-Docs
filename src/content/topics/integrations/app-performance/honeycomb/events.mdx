## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Honeycomb events integration.

The LaunchDarkly Honeycomb integration helps you diagnose problems by sending flag events to Honeycomb. Honeycomb displays those events alongside performance graphs so you can correlate feature rollouts with changes in operational health.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The integration only sends flag actions to Honeycomb</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

 Only flag action events appear in Honeycomb after you configure the integration. Other event types do not appear. To learn more, read [Feature flag actions](/home/members/role-actions#feature-flags-actions).

<CalloutTitle>This integration supports triggers</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can use LaunchDarkly's triggers feature with Honeycomb to automatically perform actions on feature flags. To learn more, read [Using triggers with Honeycomb](/integrations/honeycomb/triggers).

To send flag change events to Honeycomb:

1. [Create a Honeycomb API key](#creating-a-honeycomb-api-key).
2. [Add the Honeycomb integration in LaunchDarkly](#adding-the-honeycomb-integration).
3. (Optional) [Configure the integration's policy](#configuring-integration-policies) to allow or restrict specific projects and environments.

## Prerequisites

To use the LaunchDarkly Honeycomb integration successfully, you must meet the
following prerequisites:

* You must have an API key from your Honeycomb account. To learn more,
  read [Creating a Honeycomb API key](#creating-a-honeycomb-api-key).

## Creating a Honeycomb API key

The Honeycomb API key authenticates the LaunchDarkly integration so it can
submit events to your Honeycomb account. The LaunchDarkly integration uses
Honeycomb's Marker API.

To learn more about Honeycomb's  Marker API, read
[Honeycomb's documentation](https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/markers/).

When you create the API key, confirm that the key has access to create
"markers". This is the only access scope the LaunchDarkly integration needs.

## Adding the Honeycomb integration

Here's how to add the Honeycomb integration:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find the Honeycomb card.

2. Click **Add integration**. The integration configuration screen appears.
3. (Optional) Type a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter the **Honeycomb dataset name** you would like flag markers to be associated with.
5. Paste in your **Honeycomb API key**.
6. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which flag information LaunchDarkly sends to Honeycomb. To learn more, read [Configuring integration policies](#configuring-integration-policies).
7. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
8. Click **Save configuration**.


### Configuring integration policies

The "Policy" field in the integration configuration screen lets you control which events LaunchDarkly sends to Honeycomb.

The Resource specifier in the default policy value allows Production environments across all projects to send events:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json" values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```text
proj/*:env/production:flag/*
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [Resources in custom
roles](/home/members/role-resources).

You can use the policy editor to restrict the integration to:

* a specific set of LaunchDarkly projects/environments
* a specific set of flags
* a specific set of actions

For example, to restrict the policy to a single project called `cool-app`, set
the policy configuration's `resource` field to the following resource specifier:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json" values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```text
proj/cool-app:env/production:flag/*
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The policy above makes the integration only send flag events from the `cool-app` project's Production environment to Honeycomb.

If you need to restrict or allow a more complex set of resources than you can
specify in a single policy, you can add multiple Honeycomb
integrations and configure each one to a specific task. Each integration can
have its own separate policy configuration.

To learn more about using the policy editor, read [Policies in custom
roles](/home/members/role-policies).
