## Overview

This topic explains how to create and enable feature flags using Bitbucket Pipelines.

The LaunchDarkly integration lets you insert feature flag actions directly into your Pipeline's continuous delivery flow. [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines) is a continuous delivery platform that lets your team build, test, and deploy from Bitbucket. It exists within Bitbucket, giving you end-to-end visibility from coding to deployment.

We provide two scripts you can add to your pipelines:

- **Create feature flags in your Pipelines build**: This lets you create feature flags within a specified project. The feature flag will be created in all environments for that project.
- **Enable a feature flag in your Pipelines build**: This lets you turn on a specific feature flag for a specific environment within a project.

## Prerequisites

To use the LaunchDarkly Bitbucket Pipelines integration, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- [A Bitbucket account](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/)

- [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines) installed on your Bitbucket account
- A GitHub account

## Creating feature flags in your Pipelines build

You can configure a Bitbucket Pipeline step to create a set of feature flags in LaunchDarkly as part of your build process.

To set up your Bitbucket Pipeline with LaunchDarkly:

1. Copy the `create-launchdarkly-flags.sh` shell script from our [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/launchdarkly/launchdarkly-pipelines/src).
2. Add `create-launchdarkly-flags.sh` to your Pipelines build configuration.
3. Add two environment variables to your Pipelines settings:
   - `LAUNCHDARKLY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Copy your API access token from the [Authorizations tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/authorization) within Account settings.
   - `LAUNCHDARKLY_PROJECT_KEY`: Copy your project key from your [LaunchDarkly Projects tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) within Account settings.

Be careful to use the LaunchDarkly **project key** in the Bitbucket Pipelines settings, not the environment key. The
screenshot below calls out both the project and environment keys.

4. Add an `ld-flags.conf` file to your repository and declare flags in it.

When your Pipelines build runs, any feature flags you declare in this file is also created in LaunchDarkly.

## Enabling a feature flag in your Pipelines build

You can configure a Pipeline step that enables an existing feature flag in an environment as part of your build.

To enable feature flags with Bitbucket Pipelines:

1. Copy the `enable-launchdarkly-flags.sh` shell script from our [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/launchdarkly/launchdarkly-pipelines/src).
2. Add `enable-launchdarkly-flags.sh` to your Pipelines build configuration.
3. Add these environment variables to your Pipelines settings:
   - `LAUNCHDARKLY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Copy your API access token from the [Authorization tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/authorization).
   - `LAUNCHDARKLY_PROJECT_KEY`: Copy your project key from your [LaunchDarkly Projects tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).
   - `LAUNCHDARKLY_ENVIRONMENT_KEY`: Copy your environment key from your [LaunchDarkly Projects tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).
   - `LAUNCHDARKLY_FLAG_KEY`: Enter the key for the feature flag you wish to enable.
