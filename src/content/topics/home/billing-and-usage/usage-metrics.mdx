## Overview

This topic explains how to understand the billing and usage metrics visualized in the Account Settings page. It introduces the concept of Monthly Active Users (MAU), an amount of unique identifiers designated in your LaunchDarkly plan.

## Understanding how LaunchDarkly calculates Monthly Active Users (MAU)

LaunchDarkly calculates client-side MAUs as unique keys that evaluate, initialize, or identify any flag from a client SDK. The amount of these keys is designated per account. We count unique user keys that are evaluated by a flag, so even if a single user account evaluates flags from multiple device types or over multiple sessions, we count that user as one MAU over the 30-day period.

You can see this data visualized in **Account Settings** > **Usage**.

LaunchDarkly usage charts also show you the number of unique keys per Project and per Environment. Your usage is based on the total number of unique user keys across your entire account. The Monthly Active Users chart shows the total number of unique keys over the previous 30-day rolling period.

Here is an example Usage dashboard screen:

Project MAU and account MAU are not always the same number. MAU charts count unique users for a specific Project or Environment. Users can be active in multiple projects or environments, contributing to the unique user counts in each context.

* The Overview tab shows the unique client MAUs at the account level
* The client tab can show all the unique client MAUs from each named project, *or*
* The client tab can show all the unique client MAUs from each named environment

For example, LaunchDarkly may be seeing 10K unique user keys for Project A and 10K for Project B, but if there is any overlap in the user base your account may be serving 13k unique user keys.

A detailed breakdown of the user key allocation follows:

* Total keys in Project A: 10k
* Total keys in Project B: 10k
* Keys that exist in **both** projects A and B: 7k
* Keys **only** in project A: 3k
* Keys **only** in project B: 3k
* Total unique keys: 13k

The keys that exist in only one project (3k in each project, which adds up to 6k total) are added to the keys that exist in both projects (7k) to show 13k unique keys in your account.

### Understanding client-side MAU limits

Your LaunchDarkly plan includes a client-side MAU limit. We understand that a company's user base can grow unexpectedly over time. We never stop or throttle service if you exceed your MAU limit, nor do we bill you for MAU overages. All users in your environment will continue to evaluate feature flags correctly, regardless of your MAU.

If you exceed your client-side MAU limit, new users and changes to existing users, such as new attributes, do not appear in the dashboard. The user information on the dashboard has a Time to Live (TTL) of 30 days. No users receive updates while you are over your MAU limit, so all of your users become stale after 30 days and will be removed until you are back under your contracted MAU limit.

If you have configured LaunchDarkly to use anonymous users, that can impact your MAU as well. To learn more, read [Understanding how anonymous users contribute to MAU](/home/users/anonymous-users#understanding-how-anonymous-users-contribute-to-mau).

## Understanding billing metrics

Billing metrics are located under **Account Settings** > **Billing**.

Billing metrics show you:

- How many client-side MAUs you’re tracking in LaunchDarkly
- How many projects and environments you have set up
- How many seats you’re using under your plan
- How many Experimentation events you're using
- How many Data Export events you're using

You can easily see your usage, and adjust your plan as you need to accommodate your application’s or organization’s growth. To learn more, read [Your Billing tab](/home/billing/billing-tab).

## Understanding usage metrics

Usage metrics are located under **Account Settings** > **Usage**. These usage metrics tell you more about how your application and members of your organization are using LaunchDarkly.

Usage metrics tell you:

- How many LaunchDarkly seats, projects, and environments your organization is using.
- How many unique MAUs LaunchDarkly is tracking, broken out by browser and mobile MAUs.
- How many server connections your application has with LaunchDarkly. You can visualize them by hour, day, or over the past month to see trends.

If you have Experimentation or Data Export enabled, you can see metrics related to that usage.

- For Experimentation, you can see the number of experiment events, as well as the average over the last hour, up to the last 60 days.
- For Data Export, you can see the number of events published along with the average, from a time period as short as one hour to as long as the last 60 days.
