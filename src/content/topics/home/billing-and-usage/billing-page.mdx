### Core usage

The "Core usage" section lists the total number of seats available and in use in your account. You can adjust your seat usage using the slider, or upgrade your plan using the upgrade link.

### Add-ons

The configuration options in the "Add-ons" section vary depending on what plan you're using.

On a **Starter plan** you can:

- View your client-side MAUs
- Turn SSO on or off

On a **Pro plan** you can:

- Adjust your client-side MAUs using the slider
- Add Experimentation to your plan, or adjust the number of Experimentation events using the slider
- Enable or disable SSO

### Plan summary

Your plan summary lists the number of seats in your account and any add-ons.

You can toggle between the "billed monthly" and "billed annually" option to see the price difference between the two billing frequencies.

To confirm changes to your core usage, add-ons, or billing frequency:

1. In the plan summary section, click **Review your changes**. A "Review your subscription changes" screen appears.
2. Click **Update subscription**.

To cancel your changes and return to the Billing tab, click **Keep current plan**.
