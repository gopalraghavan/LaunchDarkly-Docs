## Overview

This topic explains how to use required comments for feature flag changes.

Comments help establish a change history for a feature flag. Requiring members to leave comments when they change flags or segments helps your organization understand why flags or segments look and behave certain ways.

When **Require comments** is enabled, the LaunchDarkly dashboard requires members to explain their changes. Comments are not required for changes made with the LaunchDarkly API.

When you require comments in an environment, members must leave a comment when saving any changes to a flag:
