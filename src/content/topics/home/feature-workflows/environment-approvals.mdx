## Overview

This topic explains how to customize how approval requests work for each environment in your LaunchDarkly project. You can also require approvals on flag-level changes in any environment.

For example, you can prevent a proposed change from being applied if any reviewer declines an approval request for the Production environment. Or you may allow anyone, including the person making the approval request, to approve and apply a proposed change in the QA environment.

## Configuring approval settings

You can customize how approval requests are managed and enforced by making changes in the **Approval settings** menu.

In this menu, you can customize who can approve a request and how many approvals are required before a requestor can apply a change. These settings can be useful when you want to use approval requests to track the changes you make to a flag, but don't want to delay applying those changes based on who has approved them.

To configure approvals by environment:

1. Navigate to **Account settings** and click into the **Projects** tab.
2. Find the environment you wish to modify.
3. Click the **overflow menu** and choose **Approval settings** from the dropdown. The **Approval settings** menu appears:

4. Make other configuration changes you wish. Information on configurable fields in the "Approval settings" menu below, after this procedure.
6. Click **Save Settings**.


In the **Approval settings** menu, you can configure the following fields:

* **Approval System**: Select to manage approvals either within LaunchDarkly or with a third-party tool.
* **Require approvals for this environment**: Select this checkbox to require approval for flag targeting changes in this environment:
  * **Require approvals for all flags in this environment**: Select to require approval for all flag targeting changes.
  * **Require approvals for specific flags in this environment**: Select to require approval for only flag targeting changes on flags with the listed tags. While tags are global across environments, this setting applies only to flags in the current environment.
* **Requesters can review their own request**: Select this checkbox to allow anyone who makes an approval request to approve or decline that request. This allows someone who makes an approval request to apply their own change.
* **Allow modifying and deleting pending changes without approval**: Select this checkbox to stop creating approval requests when an account member deletes or modifies a pending change.
* **Minimum number of approvals**: Enter a number to set the amount of approvals required before a member can apply a change. The minimum is one and the maximum is five.
* **Disable the option to 'Apply Changes' if any reviewers have declined a request**: Select this option to prevent the requested change from being applied if any reviewer has declined their approval request:

## Requiring approvals in an environment

You can require any change made to a flag in this environment to go through an approval process. This creates a workflow where any environment-specific flag change must have a reviewer's approval before it can be implemented.

To require approvals on flag changes:

1. Navigate to **Account settings** and click into the **Projects** tab.
2. Find the environment you wish to modify.
3. Click the **overflow menu** and choose **Approval settings** from the dropdown. The **Approval settings** menu appears:

    ![An environment's overflow menu, with the "Approval settings" option called out.](approvals-environment-overflow-callout.png)
4. Select the **Require approvals for this environment** checkbox:

5. Make any other configuration changes you wish.
6. Click **Save Settings**.

### Understanding how required approvals work

When you select the **Require approvals for this environment** checkbox in the "Approval settings" menu, it requires any flag targeting change to receive an approval before implementation.

If you enable this feature, the following behaviors change:
* When you toggle a flag on or off from the Flags dashboard, the "Request approvals" screen appears.
* After any change to flag configuration on the flag's Targeting page, the **Save Changes** button changes to **Request Approval**. When you click it, the "Request approvals" screen appears.
* On the Users page, when you change flag targeting for a user, the **Save changes** button changes to **Request Approval**. When you click it, the "Request approvals" screen appears.

For all three of these changes, the flag state does not change until a reviewer approves and applies the change.

<CalloutDescription>

Approval workflows only impact flag targeting settings within an environment. When you select the **Require approvals for this environment** checkbox, project-level flag changes are not included.

The following actions do **not** trigger an approval request:

* Changes to the flag's name
* Changes to the flag's maintainer
* Changes to the flag's description
* Changes to the flag's tags
* Changes to the flag's variations
* Creating a flag
* Archiving a flag
* Deleting a flag

To prevent members from making these kinds of changes, you can configure and assign custom roles that deny these actions. To learn how, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).
