## Overview

This topic explains how to build, start, and view workflows in LaunchDarkly. A workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes to a feature flag.

## Using workflows

Workflows can automate some of the manual tasks required to manage a feature flag. These tasks often take place in stages. For example, a feature flag workflow that gradually releases a flag to more users might look like this:

Workflows support consistent release practices and let you automatically release a feature based on your release process.

### Prerequisites

To use workflows, you should understand the following features:

* [Approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals)
* [Scheduled flag changes](/home/feature-workflows/scheduled-changes)

## Setting up a workflow

To build a workflow:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag you want to create a workflow for. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Click **Create a workflow**.
4. Give your workflow a name, and optionally add a description.
5. (Optional) If you have an approvals process, click **Request approval**.
  * Click into the **Reviewers** dropdown and choose an approver.
  * Enter a description in the **Description** field.
  * You must add approval steps before you add schedule steps. If you accidentally add a schedule step first, delete the schedule step, and then add the approval step as the first step of that stage.
7. If you don't need to request approval, click **Schedule date and time**.
8. Choose a date and time from the date picker.
9. Click the **+** to add another step to your workflow.
10. Choose one or multiple flag changes you want to make.
11. Add another approval and/or schedule condition step to create another stage of the workflow.
12. After you have added all of your release steps to the workflow, click **Start workflow**.

LaunchDarkly now processes the workflow steps for you based on the timeline and actions that you defined.

## Viewing a workflow

There are two ways to view active workflows for a feature flag. You can use the progress bar or view the workflows in a list.

### Progress bar

To view the status of a workflow on the Targeting page:

1. Navigate to the flags dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. View active workflows listed at the top of the targeting page.

3. Click a stage bubble for more information on what actions are being taken in that stage.

### List view

To view the list of active workflows on a feature flag:

1. Navigate to the flags dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. Click the **Workflows** tab to view a list of all active workflows.

## Deleting a workflow

There may be cases where you need to delete a workflow. Deleting a workflow stops any further stages from executing. It does not undo any changes that the workflow has already made.

To delete a workflow:

1. Navigate to the flags dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
3. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
4. Click on the **overflow** menu next to the workflow you want to delete.
5. Select **Delete workflow**.

3. Enter the flag name or key to confirm the deletion.

## Understanding permissions in workflows

A LaunchDarkly member must have permission to make flag changes to create workflows, because workflows inherit permissions from flags. To learn more about how to configure the right permissions for members, read [Resources](/home/members/role-resources).
