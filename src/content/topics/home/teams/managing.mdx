## Overview

This topic explains how to manage team members, team maintainers and team permissions in LaunchDarkly and shows you how to use the Teams tab.

## Managing team members

If you have an `owner / admin` role, you are a maintainer of the team, or you have the required custom role permissions, you can add and remove team members from new and existing teams.

### Adding a member to an existing team

If you have an existing team and you want to add a member to it:

1. Navigate to [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings).
2. Click into the [Teams](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/teams) tab.
3. Click on the name of the team to navigate to that team's page. The team's "Team members" tab appears.
4. Click **Add members**. The "Add members" modal appears.
5. Select the members to add to the team.
6. Click the **Add members** button.

### Adding members in bulk to an existing team

You can add multiple members to an existing team by uploading a CSV file of member email addresses. Your CSV file must include email addresses in the first column. You can include data in additional columns, but LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional.

To upload a CSV file:

1. Navigate to [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings).
2. Click into the [Teams](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/teams) tab.
3. Click on the name of the team you want to add members to. The team's "Team members" tab appears.
4. Click **Upload CSV**. The "Upload CSV" screen appears:

![The Upload CSV screen.](teams-upload-csv-modal.png)

5. Click **Select file**. A prompt to choose a file appears.
6. Choose a CSV file. You are returned to the "Upload CSV" screen.
7. Click **Upload file.**

A success indicator appears with the number of team members successfully added to your team. 

If the file upload was not successful, an error message appears with information about the errors in the file.

There are two types of CSV file upload errors:
- **Global errors** are errors at the file level preventing LaunchDarkly from processing the file.
- **Line errors** are errors on one or more individual lines in your CSV file.

### Troubleshooting global errors

Global errors mean that something is wrong at the file level preventing LaunchDarkly from processing the file. You must resolve the errors in your file and try uploading again.

This table includes a list of global errors and how to resolve them:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Error message</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Resolution</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
    <TableCell>Unable to process file</TableCell>
    <TableCell>LaunchDarkly could not process the file for an unspecified reason. Review your file for errors and try again.</TableCell>

### Troubleshooting line errors

Line errors mean that something is wrong with one or more individual lines in your CSV file. You can either add only the valid entries from your CSV file, or upload a new file.

This table includes a list of line errors and how to resolve them:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Error message</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Resolution</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
    <TableCell>Empty row</TableCell>
    <TableCell>This line is blank. Add an email address and try again.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>Duplicate entry</TableCell>
    <TableCell>This email address appears in the file twice. Remove the email from the file and try again.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>Email already exists in the specified team</TableCell>
    <TableCell>This member is already on your team. No action needed.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>Invalid formatting</TableCell>
    <TableCell>This email address is not formatted correctly. Fix the formatting and try again.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>Email does not belong to LaunchDarkly member</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The email address doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team. To learn how, read <a href="/home/members/managing#adding-members-to-launchdarkly">Adding members to LaunchDarkly</a>.</TableCell>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Maintained teams do not necessarily appear in the "Teams" column</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
