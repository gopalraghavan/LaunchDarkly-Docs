## Overview

This topic explains how to set up the Relay Proxy's automatic configuration feature.

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Relay Proxy automatic configuration is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Relay Proxy automatic configuration is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

With automatic configuration, the Relay Proxy automatically detects and supports new connections to updated or new environments whenever changes occur that impact LaunchDarkly SDK keys, mobile keys, or client-side IDs.

## Benefits of automatic configuration

In a standard Relay Proxy, without automatic configuration, whenever you add or make changes to environments and projects in LaunchDarkly, you must manually update configuration files and restart the Relay Proxy to reflect the changes.

With automatic configuration enabled, you no longer need to manually update the Relay Proxy's configuration files after you make configuration changes, nor do you need to restart the Relay Proxy for changes to take effect.

Additionally, you can use a page in the LaunchDarkly UI to configure your Relay Proxy with the automatic configuration feature. A standard Relay Proxy requires all environments to be defined individually, and you cannot configure it through the LaunchDarkly UI.

If you enable automatic configuration, your Relay Proxy automatically detects and reacts to events like:

* SDK key rotation
* Mobile key rotation
* Environment state changes, like new environment creation, name and tag updates, and environment deletion
* Project state changes, like new project creation, name and tag updates, and project deletion

This prevents you from needing to restart your Relay Proxy instances and potentially cause downtime while applying changes. These changes have no impact on your Relay Proxy's performance.

With automatic configuration enabled, you only need to restart the Relay Proxy to upgrade it.

## Enabling automatic configuration

Enabling automatic configuration is a two-step process. These steps appear in detail below.

You must:

1. Create a Relay Proxy configuration in the [Relay Proxy section](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/relay) of the **Account Settings** page and save its unique key.
2. Configure your Relay Proxy instance to use the unique key from the prior step. You may do so either as a property in your Relay Proxy configuration file or as an environment variable.

<CalloutTitle>Save the Relay Proxy's unique key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you create a new Relay Proxy, LaunchDarkly assigns a unique key to it. You must save the key immediately after you create the Relay Proxy, because the key is only viewable on creation.

Here's how to create a Relay Proxy configuration in the LaunchDarkly UI:

1. Navigate to the **Account Settings** page and click into the [**Relay Proxy** tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/relay):

![The Relay Proxy tab on the Account Settings page.](account-settings-relay-proxy.png)

2. Click **Create configuration**. The Relay Proxy configuration screen appears.
3. Give the Relay Proxy a human-readable **Name**.
4. Choose a **Rule** from the dropdown. This rule determines what content the Relay Proxy receives.
 * **All projects and environments** sends changes about all projects and environments to the Relay Proxy.
 * **Inline policy** allows you to specify which projects and environments you can track events for. To learn more, read [Writing an inline policy](#writing-an-inline-policy):

![The Relay Proxy configuration screen with dropdown displayed.](relay-proxy-config-dropdown.png)

5. Click **Save configuration**. The Relay Proxy appears on the Relay Proxy tab of the Account Settings page with its key visible.
6. Copy and save the key somewhere secure:

![The Relay Proxy screen with a newly created Relay Proxy. The key is displayed.](relay-proxy-key-displayed.png)

Next you must specify the key in a Relay Proxy configuration file so it includes the configuration you created.

1. Configure your Relay Proxy to use your new key.
 * If you configured the Relay Proxy with a configuration file, specify the Relay Proxy key in an `AutoConfig` section as the `key` property.
 * If configured the Relay Proxy with environment variables, specify the Relay Proxy key with the `AUTO_CONFIG_KEY` environment variable. Here's how:

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="file"
    values={[
      { label: 'Configuration file', value: 'file', },
      { label: 'Environment variables', value: 'env-var', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="file">

  ```bash
[AutoConfig]
   key = "rel-EXAMPLE-RELAY-PROXY-CONFIGURATION-KEY"
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  <CodeTabItem value="env-var">

  ```bash
docker run --name ld-relay           \
   -e AUTO_CONFIG_KEY="rel-EXAMPLE-RELAY-PROXY-CONFIGURATION-KEY" \
   launchdarkly/ld-relay
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>

2. Start the Relay Proxy.

From now on, the Relay Proxy will respond automatically to the project and environment state changes you specified.

## Writing an inline policy

You can use the inline policy editor to specify precise instructions on what environments and projects the Relay Proxy should include or exclude. You can write policies by hand to get exactly the outcomes you want.

There are three ways to write an inline policy:

- Simple editor
- Resource finder
- Advanced editor

Each of these methods is described below.

### Using the simple editor

You can create simple, one-line policies using the simple editor. To learn learn more about policy syntax, read [Resource specifiers](/home/members/role-policies#resource-specifiers).

To use the simple editor from the "Create a Relay Proxy configuration" screen:

1. Choose "inline policy" from the **Rule** dropdown.
2. Enter a policy in the "Choose resources for this policy statement" field. In this example, the Relay Proxy has access to all environments within the `default` project.

5. Click **Save configuration**.

### Using the resource finder

Here is how to create an inline policy using the resource finder from the "Create a Relay Proxy configuration" screen:

1. Choose "inline policy" from the **Rule** dropdown.
2. Click **Resource finder**. A "Find a resource" screen appears.

![The Find a resource screen.](images/relay-proxy-find-a-resource.png)

3. Search for the environment or project you want the Relay Proxy to have access to.
4. Select the resource. The resource appears in the "Choose resources for this policy statement" field.
5. Click **Save configuration**.

### Using the advanced editor

To write more complicated policies you can use the advanced editor. To learn how to write advanced policies, read [Understanding policies](/home/members/role-policies#understanding-policies).

To use the advanced editor from the "Create a Relay Proxy configuration" screen:

1. Choose "inline policy" from the **Rule** dropdown.
2. Click **Advanced editor**. The advanced editor window opens.
3. Enter your policy.
5. Click **Save configuration**.
