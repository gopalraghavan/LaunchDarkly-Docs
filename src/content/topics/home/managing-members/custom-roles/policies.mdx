## Overview

This topic explains how to write policies for  custom roles, integrations access, and Relay Proxy access.

Policies combine resources and actions into a set of statements that define what users can or cannot do in LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Custom role concepts](/home/members/role-concepts).

## Using the policy algorithm

The algorithm for determining whether a policy allows or denies access is as follows:

- If any statement in the policy explicitly denies access to a resource and action, access is denied. This statement overrides any other statement in the policy that allows access to the resource and action.
- If a statement in the policy explicitly allows access to a resource and action, and no statement denies access, access is allowed.
- If two policies have conflicting permission levels, the more permissive level of access is applied.
- Any resource or action not specifically included in a policy is denied by default, except the `viewProject` action and the `createAccessToken` action.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>All roles can view all projects by default</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The ability to view and change resources is configured at the `project` resource level with the `viewProject` action. All custom role recipients can see all projects in your LaunchDarkly instance unless specifically denied.<br/><br/>

Custom role recipients can also create access tokens that are limited to their existing permissions. For example, account members with `reader` level permissions can only create tokens with `reader` permissions, whereas admins and owners can create tokens with any permission level.<br/><br/>

To learn  more, read [Understanding the minimum required actions for a role](/home/members/role-concepts#understanding-the-minimum-required-actions-for-a-role).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Statement order does not matter. You can assign multiple custom roles to one member, and each custom role has its own policy.

Permissions are cumulative. If you assign multiple custom roles to a member, and one of those custom roles allows access to a resource, then access is allowed even if other roles deny that access. Adding roles to a user can only increase that user's access.

## Understanding policies

Policies are represented as JSON arrays.

Each element in the array is a statement represented as a JSON object with three attributes:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Attribute name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>effect</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell><code>allow</code> or <code>deny</code>.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>resources / notResources</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        A list of resource specifiers defining the resources to which the statement applies or does not apply.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>actions / notActions</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        A list of action specifiers defining the actions to which the statement applies or does not apply.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

<Callout intent="info">

<CalloutDescription>

You can only create a statement using `notActions` or `notResources` in the advanced editor. To learn more about the advanced editor, read [Writing policies in the advanced editor](#writing-policies-in-the-advanced-editor).

### Resource specifiers

Resource specifiers allow you to define which resources to allow or deny access to. Three commonly-used resources in custom role policies are projects, environments, and flags.

Here is how to express these resources in code:

- `proj/KEY`
- `proj/*:env/KEY`
- `proj/*:env/*:flag/KEY`

For a full list of available resources, read [Using actions](/home/members/role-actions).

In these expressions `KEY` is the key of the project, environment, or flag. You can use the asterisk `*` as a wildcard character to indicate that all resources of that type should be matched. For example, `proj/*` indicates all projects within your account.

The colon `:` within a policy indicates that the resource after the `:` resides within the resource before the `:`. For example, `proj/account-management:env/production` refers to the `production` environment within the `account-management` project only. To learn more, read [Understanding the resource specifier syntax](/home/members/role-resources#understanding-the-resource-specifier-syntax).

### Writing policies in the advanced editor

The LaunchDarkly UI has a structured series of fields you can use to create policies. If you want to write a policy by hand, however, you can use the advanced editor.

To access the advanced editor:

1. Navigate to **Account settings**.
2. Click into the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **Create role**. The "Create custom role" screen appears.
4. Click **Advanced editor**. The advanced editor opens:

![The advanced editor.](settings-roles-advanced-editor.png)

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Resources are case-sensitive</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When constructing your policy by hand with the advanced editor, make sure to use the resource key, which is case sensitive. If the Production environment of your default project has the key `production` then `proj/default:env/Production` will not allow actions to be taken in your default project's production environment.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The following example policy denies access to the `account-management` project. It also allows all actions on the `checkout-flow` flag in all projects and environments.

Here's the example policy:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "notResources": ["proj/account-management"],
    "actions": ["viewProject"],
    "effect": "deny"
  },
  {
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/checkout-flow"],
    "actions": ["*"],
    "effect": "allow"
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

In the next example, the environment key `production` represents the account's Production environment. This statement denies the user from modifying any feature flags in production:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Statement', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"],
    "actions": ["*"]
  }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also name an "inverse" set of resources by using `notResources` in a statement. This statement explicitly allows all actions to feature flags across all environments _except_ the production environment.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'notResources statement', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "notResources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"],
    "actions": ["*"]
  }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
