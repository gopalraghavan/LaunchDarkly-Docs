## Overview

This topic explains the built-in roles that come with every LaunchDarkly project, and how they relate to each other.

## Understanding LaunchDarkly's built-in roles

Every LaunchDarkly account has three built-in roles: `reader`, `writer`, and `owner / admin`. Customers on an Enterprise plan also have a restricted `no access` role.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The no access role is for Early Access Program customers only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The `no access` role is limited to a subset of customers in LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, email product@launchdarkly.com.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The first account member who created your LaunchDarkly account is granted `owner` permissions automatically, because those permissions are required to configure your account and add more account members. You can change the account owner when there is more than one account member in your LaunchDarkly project. To learn more, read [Changing account owners](/home/account-security/account-owners).

You must assign each additional account member at least one role. You can assign account members a built-in role or one or more custom roles to give them the exact set of permissions they need.

You must set an account member's initial role when you invite them to LaunchDarkly. LaunchDarkly assigns new account members the `reader` role by default, unless you choose a different starting role. If an account member needs more advanced permissions, an account member with permissions to do so must adjust their role under the Members tab on the Account Settings page.

The built-in roles are explained in more detail in this table:

  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>reader</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Readers can see information in LaunchDarkly, but can't modify it. This role is for members of your
        organization who need visibility into your feature flags, but shouldn’t be able to modify rollout rules or
        administrative settings.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>writer</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Writers can make changes to LaunchDarkly that impact what the platform does. For example, they can modify
        feature flags, metrics, environments, projects, and more. They can’t add new account members to the account or manage your payment method or plans. This role for members who need the ability to configure your organization's feature flags.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>admin</code> and <code>owner/admin</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Admins can do anything in LaunchDarkly except modify which account member has the owner role. You can have
        multiple admins in your LaunchDarkly account.

        <br />
        Owners can do anything Admins can do in LaunchDarkly, as well as reassign the owner role to another account member.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>no access</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The <code>no access</code> role prevents members from accessing any part of the LaunchDarkly
        platform. This role is for members who shouldn't be able to see or modify anything until you give them access to specific areas of LaunchDarkly.

        Customers on an Enterprise plan with access to the teams feature can add members to teams to give them additional permissions. To learn more, read <a href="/home/teams">Teams</a>.

    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

## Understanding how built-in roles interact with custom roles

You can give account members granular control to LaunchDarkly using custom roles. Custom roles let you define specific permissions for members or teams and apply them across your organization.

This is useful if you have members with multiple jobs, such as someone who needs access to flags controlled by an engineering team and the support team, or product managers who also code.

To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles). To view the current roles for an account member, read [Viewing an individual member's roles](/home/members/custom-roles#viewing-an-individual-members-roles).
