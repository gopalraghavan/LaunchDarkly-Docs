## Getting started as a software developer

As a software developer, you're responsible for creating and implementing feature flags in code.

First, you must set up a LaunchDarkly SDK to integrate LaunchDarkly with your code. To learn more, read [Setting up an SDK](/home/getting-started/setting-up). For information about how to choose an SDK, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side). After you've set up a LaunchDarkly SDK, you can [create your first feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

For a guided example of these steps, read [Configuring an SDK and creating a flag](/guides/tutorials/sdk-flag). This tutorial explains how to set up an SDK and create a flag in LaunchDarkly. If you'd prefer something even quicker, try the in-app [tutorial](https://app.launchdarkly.com/get-started/tutorial).

Once you have a basic understanding of flags, you can work with others in your organization to determine how you want to target flag variations to users or segments. To learn more, read [Targeting users with flags](/home/flags/targeting-users).

As you add more flags, you can start organizing your flags across different environments. To learn more, read [Organizing your flags](/home/organize). This is also a good time to start thinking about managing the lifecycle of each flag. To learn more, read [Flags in your codebase](/home/code).

For more ideas on what comes next, read [Additional resources](#additional-resources).

## Getting started as a product manager

As a product manager or rollout manager, you are likely responsible for coordinating deployments and feature releases.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Try an interactive demo</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you haven't worked directly with feature flags before, LaunchDarkly has an example application you can play with. From the Guide menu, select [Get started](https://app.launchdarkly.com/get-started), and then choose **Try an interactive demo**.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

First, learn how to [turn feature flags on and off](/home/getting-started/toggle). Then, start thinking about how you'd like to [target flag variations to users or segments](/home/flags).

As a product manager, you may also build and monitor experiments to understand the impact of features you roll out. Each experiment is a set of actions used to test a hypothesis. You can use feature flags to send flag variations to portions of your user base, and compare your users' different reactions. You can use this for A/B/n testing, acceptance testing, and stress testing. To learn more, read [Experimentation](/home/experimentation).

For more ideas on what comes next, read [Additional resources](#additional-resources).


## Getting started as a systems architect

As a systems architect, you're responsible for designing services and processes for your organization's engineering team.

Now that your engineering team is using LaunchDarkly, you can make LaunchDarkly a seamless part of your workflow. Integrations let you configure the product, receive LaunchDarkly events, or use triggers to perform actions on feature flags from third-party tools. For example, LaunchDarkly integrates with various application performance management (APM) tools, with collaboration tools like Slack, with IDE connectors, with workflow management tools, and with several other productivity and management applications. To learn more, read [Integrations](/integrations).

To learn about common problems integrations can help solve, read [Integrations use cases](/guides/best-practices/integrations-use-cases). For best practices to help you succeed with LaunchDarkly on specific platforms, read our [platform-specific guides](/guides/platform-specific).

For more ideas on what comes next, read [Additional resources](#additional-resources).

## Getting started as an account administrator

As an account administrator, you are likely responsible for managing account members, monitoring billing and usage, and facilitating any integrations.

First, learn about how to [set up and manage account members](/home/members). Each member can have one of three built-in roles within LaunchDarkly: `reader`, `writer`, or `admin`. To learn more, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles). If you would like to set up more precise access control, you can configure custom roles for your members. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

Next, make sure you understand the options for securing your account, including how to precisely manage which account members can perform certain actions and how to enable multi-factor authentication and single sign-on in your LaunchDarkly account. To learn more, read [Securing your account](/home/account-security).

If you are in a larger organization, you may also think about grouping your account members into [teams](/home/teams). Teams allow you to control permissions for groups of account members, rather than for individuals. Additionally, teams allow you to map permissions in LaunchDarkly to your organizational structure. For example, you can give mobile flag permissions to the mobile team and desktop flag permissions to the desktop team.

Once your account is set up and your organization has started using feature flags, you can use LaunchDarkly's data visualization tools to [understand your monthly billing metrics](/home/billing).

* [Tutorial](https://app.launchdarkly.com/get-started/tutorial): The in-app LaunchDarkly tutorial.
* [Configuring an SDK and creating a flag](/guides/tutorials/sdk-flag): An in-depth guide to configuring an SDK and creating a feature flag.
* [Video overview](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/channel/mli3h9o3nh?wchannelid=mli3h9o3nh&wmediaid=c9x1gyt42d): A video about targeting users based on user metadata.
* [Flag rules and targeting](/guides/tutorials/rules-and-targeting): A guide explaining how to target users with flag variations.
* [LaunchDarkly onboarding](https://launchdarkly.com/onboarding): A series of videos covering a variety of getting started topics.

After you join an account, set up your SDK, and begin using feature flags, you may want to ask some questions about your organization's implementation:

* Do we use both *temporary* and *permanent* flags in our code base?
* What naming conventions and styles are used for our different resources such as flags, segments, projects, and environments?
* How do we manage flag cleanup?
* Is there a standardized rollout strategy for new features?
* What LaunchDarkly role am I assigned and what does that mean?

To learn more about making these determinations, read [Best practices](/guides#best-practices).
