## Overview

This topic explains how to enable and disable flags in the LaunchDarkly platform.

One-click control of flag behavior is critical to nimble feature management. With LaunchDarkly, you can turn a flag on or off right from the dashboard.

<CalloutTitle>The flag toggle button is a kill switch for any feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The flag button lets you turn off a feature that's misbehaving without needing to touch any code or re-deploy your application. Wrap the entire feature in a feature flag to control or revoke its rollout seamlessly.

Here is a screenshot of the dashboard:

You can also turn a flag on or off from the flag's Targeting tab. To learn more about flag targeting, read [Targeting users](/home/flags/targeting-users).

Flag behavior can do a lot more than just turning features on or off. Continue reading to learn more.

## Turning flags on

When you create a new flag, it is turned **off** by default. You can turn the flag **on** by clicking the flag toggle button in the dashboard or the flag's Targeting tab.

To turn a flag on:

1. Navigate to the dashboard or the **Targeting** tab in the flag detail page.
2. Click the flag toggle. The toggle turns green and displays the word **on**:

To learn more about creating flags, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

## Turning flags off

When you turn a flag to **off**, you disable the targeting rules for that flag. Instead of serving an active variation, you serve the **off** variation.

In the Targeting tab, you can set an **off** variation for both boolean and multivariate flags. Boolean feature flags default to `false` when the feature flag is off.

To turn a flag off:

1. Navigate to the dashboard or the **Targeting** tab in the flag detail page.
2. Set the toggle to **off**:

If you don't specify an explicit **off** variation, LaunchDarkly serves the fallback value for the flag. You can specify the fallback value in your code's `variation` calls. This is also the value that LaunchDarkly serves if your application is unable to connect to LaunchDarkly's servers.

This value is indicated at the bottom of the Targeting tab:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Planning feature flags for future events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can schedule a flag for a particular date using scheduled flag changes, or you can use targeting rules to control what it affects and when. For example, you can serve `false` to deprecate a feature after a date of your choosing, or you can target a specific user or segment to be removed from the flag's targeting settings. To learn more, read [Targeting users](/home/flags/targeting-users).
