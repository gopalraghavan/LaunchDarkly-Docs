## Overview

This topic explains how to join LaunchDarkly as a new account member.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly is for groups and organizations</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You cannot sign up for LaunchDarkly as a user who is not associated with an organization's account. Instead, an admin or account owner from your organization must send you an invitation email. If you want to sign up for LaunchDarkly as an individual, you can sign up for a [free 14-day trial](https://launchdarkly.com/start-trial/).

## Inviting other members to LaunchDarkly

If you want to invite other members of your organization to LaunchDarkly, you have a few different options:

- You can invite [individual account members](#adding-individual-account-members)
- You can import account members from [an IDP or trial](#adding-members-who-signed-up-for-a-trial)
- Account members on a LaunchDarkly trial can join from there

<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly supports SCIM</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly supports the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) API specification for certain identity providers. SCIM is designed to make managing user identities in cloud-based applications and services easier. To use SCIM with LaunchDarkly, you must be using one of the IdPs we support that uses SCIM, and you must be an Enterprise customer.

## Adding individual account members

If your organization already has a LaunchDarkly account, an account member with invite privileges, typically an owner or admin, must send individual members email invitations to join the account.

After prospective members receive the invitation, they follow the sign up instructions to join your organization's account.

## Adding members who signed up for a trial

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Invitations fail when your email address is in use by a trial account</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If your email address is associated with a trial account, you must de-associate it or delete the trial account before you can receive an invitation email from your organization.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

A LaunchDarkly account can only have one email address associated with it, and one email address cannot be used for multiple LaunchDarkly accounts. If you used your preferred email address to sign up for a trial, you must de-associate it from the trial account before you can join your organization's LaunchDarkly account, using one of two methods:

- Changing your trial account email address
- Deleting your trial account

### Changing your trial account email address

To change the email address associated with your trial account:

1. Log in to your existing LaunchDarkly trial account.
2. Navigate to the **Account settings** page and click into the **Profile** tab.
3. Replace your original email address in the "Email address" field with a new email address.
4. Click **Update my info**.
5. Enter your original login email address and password.

You can now accept an invitation from your organization owner using the email address previously associated with the trial account.

Here is a screenshot of the Profile tab under Account settings:

### Deleting your trial account

To delete your trial account:

1. Log in to your existing LaunchDarkly account.
2. Navigate to the **Account settings** page and click into the **Members** tab.
3. Scroll to the "Delete account" section.
4. Click **Delete account**.
5. When prompted, enter your LaunchDarkly login credentials.
6. Click **Delete account** again. A prompt appears.
7. Type `yes` in the prompt to confirm.

You can now accept an invitation from your organization owner using the email address previously associated with the trial account.

## Understanding LaunchDarkly's user entity types

In LaunchDarkly, it is important to distinguish between **account members** and **users**. Here is a table explaning the difference:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Title</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Definition</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>"Account members," or "members"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        These are people who have been invited to join a LaunchDarkly account to create and manage feature flags. They can log into a company's LaunchDarkly account and view the dashboard. They may be employees of a company that uses LaunchDarkly, people with an @your-company.com email address, or people or entities associated with your identity provider (IdP).
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>"Users"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        These are people or entities who trigger flag evaluations. This can cause them to appear in the Users dashboard in LaunchDarkly, but they cannot log into the organization's LaunchDarkly account or see or modify their own or other user's data. They may be customers of a company using LaunchDarkly, consumers of an app or website that uses feature flags, or other entities that can cause flag evaluations to occur.
