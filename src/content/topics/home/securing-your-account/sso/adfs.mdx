## Overview

This topic explains how to configure SSO integration between a self-hosted Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server and LaunchDarkly.

ADFS is a service provided by Microsoft as a standard role for Windows Server. It provides a web login using existing Active Directory credentials.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Troubleshooting ADFS-based SSO</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you need information about ADFS errors during configuration, troubleshoot it by accessing the ADFS logs in the Windows Event Viewer.

## Prerequisites

To give your team access to LaunchDarkly through ADFS, you need the following components:

- An Enterprise LaunchDarkly account.
- A signed SSL certificate.
- An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.
- A Microsoft Server instance with ADFS installed and configured.

This topic does not tell you how to set up ADFS. To learn how to set up ADFS, read [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/).

## Setting up LaunchDarkly fields

Here is a table explaning LaunchDarkly fields:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>LaunchDarkly field</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Notes</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Sign-on URL</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Copy the Token Signing certificate to a Base-64 encoded x.509 file and import it into LaunchDarkly
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>X.509 certificate</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Default value: <code>https://YOUR-DOMAIN/adfs/ls/</code>. <br />
        If the default value fails, confirm that the endpoint is enabled and the URL path is correct.
        <br />
        Find the endpoint in Service > Endpoints Search for an endpoint with the <code>
          SAML 2.0/WS-Federation
        </code> type.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

## Setting up Claim issuance Policies

To set up a Claim Issuance Policy:

1. Log into the ADFS Management tool.
2. Select the **LaunchDarkly Trust**.
3. Click **Edit Claim Issuance Policy...** in the dropdown. The "Edit Claim Issuance Policy" window opens.

6. Set the following options:

- Claim rule name: Enter a human-readable name, such as "Email to NameID".
- Incoming claim type: **E-Mail Address**
- Outgoing claim type: **Name ID**
- Outgoing name ID format: **Email**

7. Select **Pass through all claim values**.
8. Click **Finish**.

ADFS is now configured with LaunchDarkly.

For more information on claim rules, read Microsoft's [Create a Rule to Transform an Incoming Claim](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-rule-to-transform-an-incoming-claim).

### Configuring custom roles

You can map LaunchDarkly custom role attributes to ADFS using a Claim issuance Policy. To learn more about SSO provisioning for roles and custom roles, read [Custom attributes](/home/account-security/sso#custom-attributes).

Before you can map custom role attributes, you must get your ADFS groups. To learn how, read Microsoft's Microsoft's [Create a Rule to Send Claims Using a Custom Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-rule-to-send-claims-using-a-custom-rule).

Your rule will look something like this:

![The edit rule window.](adfs-get-groups.png)

To send claims using a custom rule:

1. Log into the ADFS Management tool.
2. Select **LaunchDarkly Trust**.
3. Click **Edit Claim Issuance Policy...** in the dropdown. The "Edit Claim Issuance Policy" window opens.
4. Click **Add Rule**.
5. Set **Claim rule template** to **Send Claims using a custom rule**.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Enter a human-readable name, such as "Map groups to LD custom roles".
8. In the Custom rule window, enter the following:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="adfs"
  values={[
    { label: 'ADFS', value: 'adfs', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="adfs">

```
 c:[Type == "http://temp/variable"]
 => issue(Type = "customRole", Value = c.Value)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here is an image of the custom rule:

![A custom rule entered in the edit rule window.](adfs-map-groups-to-roles.png)

9. Click **OK**.

You can now assign ADFS members to custom role groups using the "Member of" tab within user properties.

## Test drive and enable

After you successfully complete the procedures in this topic, you can log in through ADFS when test drive is enabled. For more information about test drive, read [Test drive mode](/home/account-security/sso#test-drive-mode).

If you are able to successfully log in with test drive enabled, you can enable SSO fully. For more information about enabling SSO, read [Enabling SSO](/home/account-security/sso#enabling-sso).
