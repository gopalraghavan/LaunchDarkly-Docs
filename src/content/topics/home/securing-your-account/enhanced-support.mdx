## Overview

This topic explains how to enable and disable enhanced support in LaunchDarkly. Enhanced support allows us to view your account as a read-only user. This makes it easier for us to investigate issues in your LaunchDarkly account and help resolve them.

Enabling enhanced support helps us troubleshoot issues such as:

- Unexpected behavior on your dashboard
- Understanding events in the debugger
- Missing users from your Users dashboard
- Missing flag updates

You can disable enhanced support at any time.
