## Overview

This topic explains how to authenticate to the LaunchDarkly API and access LaunchDarkly's API documentation.

Every LaunchDarkly feature begins as an API endpoint. You can use the LaunchDarkly API to perform any action that's available in the LaunchDarkly product itself.

LaunchDarkly APIs let you:

* Automatically toggle feature flags
* Build custom integrations
* Export raw data to destinations outside of LaunchDarkly

## Prerequisites

To access the API, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A personal API access token, which you can generate in LaunchDarkly's **Account settings** menu. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).
* An identifying key, mobile key, or client-side ID for your SDK. Your specific requirements are determined by which SDKs you use.

## Accessing the LaunchDarkly API

Adding an `Authorization` header with your access token to your requests allows you to authenticate to the LaunchDarkly API.

We recommend accessing the API via a request header, but you can also perform API calls from the browser when you're logged in to LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read the Authentication section of the [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Authentication).
