## Overview

This topic explains how to make other changes to your feature flags in the flag's **Settings** tab.

A feature flag's Settings tab lets you change flag settings, including the name and description of the flag.

Here is an image of the flag settings tab:

The fields in the Settings tab do the following things:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Field Name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Maintainer</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The flag maintainer is the account member who's primarily responsible for the flag. By default, the maintainer is
        set to the member who created the flag, but you can assign any member of your team as the maintainer for a
        particular flag.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Name</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The feature flag's name. You can change it here.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Description</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The feature flag's description. You can change it here.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Tags</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Tags are labels that help you categorize flags. They're especially helpful for managing flag permissions with
        custom roles. For example, you can tag flags with <code>marketing</code> flags or <code>devOps</code> tags, and
        then use these tags to determine who has read or write access for the flag.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>(Checkbox) This is a permanent flag</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        You can mark flags permanent if they're intended to exist in your codebase long-term (for example, a flag that enables a site-wide maintenance mode). LaunchDarkly does not prompt you to remove permanent flags, even if one variation has been rolled out to all of your users. In addition, when someone attempts to remove a permanent flag, they receive a warning about the flag's permanent status.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>(Checkbox) SDKs using Mobile key</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before front-end calls can use them. Make this flag available to mobile SDKs by default by checking this box.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>(Checkbox) SDKs using Client-side ID</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        You must make feature flags available to the client-side SDK before front-end calls can use them. Make this flag available to the client-side SDK by default by checking this box.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Add custom property</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
      You can use custom properties to connect indidivual flags to some LaunchDarkly integrations. Click this button and choose an integration from the dropdown.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Flag keys are permanent</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

In addition to the descriptors, every flag has a unique key which you set during flag creation. Be thoughtful when you create a new flag key. You cannot change it after you save the flag.

## Sending detailed event information

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Detailed events require Data Export, an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Detailed events require Data Export, available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

LaunchDarkly summarizes flag evaluation events by default to minimize data use, and limits events transmission to 100 MBps.

If you use Data Export, you can enable it to send detailed event data for a given flag. Unlike other flag settings on this page, you can adjust this setting for each environment in the project.

To learn more, read [Data Export](/home/data-export).
