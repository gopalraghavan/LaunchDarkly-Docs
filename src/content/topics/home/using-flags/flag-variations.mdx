## Overview

This topic explains how to use a flag's **Variations** tab to create and edit your feature flag's variations and outlines the different types of flag variations.

## Understanding flag types

LaunchDarkly supports boolean and multivariate flags. On the Variations tab, you can add, edit, or delete variations of existing flags:

- **Boolean** flags have two variations: `true` or `false`.
- **Multivariate** flags can have more than two variations. The allowed variations depend on the type of flag. Multivariate flag types are strings, numbers, and JSON. To learn more, read [Understanding multivariate flags](#understanding-multivariate-flags).

<CalloutDescription>

After a feature flag has been created, you cannot change the type of its variations. For example, you can't edit a feature flag that returns numbers to make it return strings instead. To learn more about creating flags, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

When you add, edit, or delete a feature flag's variations, the change impacts environments within the project.

<CalloutTitle>Deleting variations</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you delete a variation, custom rules that return that variation are also deleted. If a custom rule has a percentage rollout, the rollout for that variation is set to zero. If the default rule returns the deleted variation, it will be changed to return the `off` variation instead.

## Understanding multivariate flags

Multivariate flags let you use one flag to serve multiple variations of a feature simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of variations you can add to a multivariate flag, making it useful for complex use cases and to manage two or more variations of a feature. For example, a multivariate flag that serves strings as variations can be used to enable different customer checkout types, serving a percentage rollout of those types to users.

Multivariate flag variation types include strings, numbers, or JSON. To learn more, read [Understanding flag types](/sdk/concepts/flag-types#understanding-flag-types).

Here is an image of a flag with a percentage rollout:

You can use custom rules to refine a rollout even more. In this example, the first rule serves two-click checkout to all users whose country is `USA`. The second rule targets users whose email ends with `example.com` and serves one-click checkout to 10%, two-click checkout to 10%, and the original checkout flow to 80% of those users. All users who are not targeted in the custom rules are served the Default rule.

To learn more about targeting rules, read [Creating targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).

You can also use multivariate flags to perform A/B/n testing with LaunchDarkly's Experimentation feature. To learn more, read [Creating Experiments](/home/experimentation/create).

## Changing default flag variations

When you create a feature flag, some of its variations are designated as *default* variations. A flag's default variations are the variations that are served when a flag is on or off unless you specify otherwise.

For example, a boolean flag could have `false` set as its default **off** variation and `true` set as its default **on** variation. A multivariate flag could have `variation 1` set as its default **off** variation and `variation 2` set as its default **on** variation, with `variation 3` and `variation 4` configured to appear in other, more specific circumstances, such as when a user is based in a specific region or has a certain email address.

Default variations are designated automatically every time you create a feature flag. You can accept the default variations or change them. When you do this and click **Save Flag**, the flag is created across all environments in your project with these variations set as its `on` and `off` values.

Here is an image of a flag's default variation options:

You can change a flag's default variations from the **Variations** tab. Update the default variations in the "Defaults for new environments" section. Subsequent environments you create also use the flag's default values. If you change the default variations and then create a new environment, however, the environment you create will use the updated default variations.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Editing default variations only impacts new environments</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you modify a flag's default variations, the updated default variations only apply to new environments. You can not change the default variations in environments that already exist.
