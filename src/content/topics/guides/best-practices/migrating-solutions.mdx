## Overview

This guide provides guidance and tips for how to effectively migrate from a third-party or homegrown feature flagging system to LaunchDarkly's feature management platform.

There are many reasons why your organization may be ready to migrate to LaunchDarkly. Some of these include:

- **Your organization needs a more sophisticated system:** You’re adding new languages to your application stack and your old flagging system can’t keep up, or your system can’t handle both client-side and server-side flag evaluations.
- **It’s burdensome to maintain your own system:** The ongoing required maintenance of your system means your engineers are spending time on internal maintenance instead of working on the service your organization provides.
- **Your projects need to scale:** Your system can’t support multiple, discrete projects, or doesn’t have the capacity to handle the variety of access permissions your teams and team members need.

After you’ve decided to retire your old system, it’s time to begin planning your migration project, along with the challenges and opportunities it presents. We recommend careful planning as a preliminary step. 

Successful migrations commonly take place over several incremental steps, rather than all at once. Tracking and visibility into the process will help you and your teams ensure a smooth rollout, as will having a failsafe in place if problems occur.

To begin the process, divide your migration into three phases: 

1. [Preparing the project](#preparing-the-project): Determine what is needed for a successful migration, and how the migration will occur.
2. [Migrating your flags](#migrating-your-flags): Recreate selected flags from the legacy system in LaunchDarkly.
3. [Planning for future use](#planning-for-future-use): Make a plan for how to go forward with day-to-day use.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A LaunchDarkly account with owner or admin access
* Administrative access to the third-party platform you're migrating from
* Familiarity with and access to the LaunchDarkly REST API is helpful, but not required. To learn more, read our [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/).

## Concepts

This guide relies on the following concepts:

### LaunchDarkly data hierarchy

​​LaunchDarkly accounts can contain one or more projects. A project can contain multiple environments, and flags exist across all environments within a project. When you create a new feature flag, it is created in every environment in your LaunchDarkly project. However, flag configuration settings are specific to each environment. The changes you make in one environment do not apply to the same flag in any other environment. If you want to, you can configure the same flag in a unique way for every environment you have.

Many software projects have a test, staging, and production environment within each project. In LaunchDarkly, you can define any environment structure that suits your team’s needs. For example, your mobile team might need an `android test`, `android prod`, `ios test`, and `ios prod` environment in a "Mobile apps" project.

To learn more, read [Projects](/home/organize/projects) and [Environments](/home/organize/environments).

## Preparing the project

Preparing for the migration may be the most important part of the process. To prepare, you’ll need to consider how to handle technical debt, any integrations you need, how to organize your flags in LaunchDarkly, and how you want to manage your teams.

### Identifying active flags

If you haven't been regularly archiving flags in your legacy solution, you may have accumulated a lot of flag debt. You may have hundreds or thousands of flags that are no longer in use. Migrating every feature flag you’ve ever created would be an overwhelming task. Instead, consider the best way to address your flag debt, as well as how to avoid accumulating more in the future. To learn more about avoiding accumulating flag debt in LaunchDarkly, read [Reducing technical debt from feature flags](/guides/best-practices/technical-debt).

Identify your permanent and active operations flags in your legacy system, as well as any others that are actively in use. You should consider any remaining flags that don't fit into one of these three categories to be legacy flags. When it is time to migrate, you will leave your legacy flags in the legacy system. To learn more how to classify flag types, read [Determining your flag's use case](/guides/best-practices/creating-flags#determining-your-flags-use-case).

It may be helpful to organize your flags into a spreadsheet to help you decide which flags to migrate and which to leave in your legacy system. Here is an example:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Legacy flag name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Permanent or operational</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>New flag name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Tags</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Team</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>2-click-checkout</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Operational</TableCell>
    <TableCell>N/A</TableCell>
    <TableCell>N/A</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Payment processing</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>currency-display</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Permanent</TableCell>
    <TableCell>item-currency-display</TableCell>
    <TableCell><code>product</code>,<code>per-flag</code>,<code>front-end</code></TableCell>
    <TableCell>Payment processing</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>background-colors</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Operational</TableCell>
    <TableCell>N/A</TableCell>
    <TableCell>N/A</TableCell>
    <TableCell>UX</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

### Creating a flag naming convention

If you didn't already have a naming convention or style guide in place for feature flags, take this opportunity to create one. Flag naming conventions help identify which team owns a flag, what release it is associated with, and the purpose of a flag. They also can help prevent technical debt from accumulating by making it easier to understand which flags can be archived when.

Things to consider when you create a naming convention: 
- Be descriptive. Verbose flag names are better than brief flag names. 
- Use prefixes with a feature name, team name, release, or other identifying elements. 
- Specify whether the flag is temporary or permanent. 
- Include a creation date for the flag to help with flag cleanup.

To learn more, read [Creating a flag naming scheme](/guides/best-practices/creating-flags#creating-a-flag-naming-scheme).

### Planning your tags

If you only have a handful of flags, it's not time-consuming to find a flag in LaunchDarkly. As your number of flags grows and more teams use feature flags, this becomes harder. Tags help you organize and sort flags into groups.  

For example, if you have flags related to experiments you can create an ‘experiments' tag. If you have flags for specific departments, you can create a tag with the department name. These tags can help you control which team members can read, write, or modify a flag. 

Before migrating, brainstorm a list of relevant tags. You can always add more tags later, but try to limit the number of tags to make things easier to find.

To learn more, read [Tags](/home/members/role-concepts#tags).

### Choosing an organization schema

The organization schema you choose for your LaunchDarkly account informs the way your account members interact with the platform and how flags are managed. There are three approaches you can take to organizing your projects, and there are pros and cons to each.

Common organizational schemas options include:

- **A separate project for each app or executable owned by a team:** This is our recommended approach for most customers. One project per app or executable is best when you are rolling out LaunchDarkly to the whole organization, or you have microservices that are functionally distinct from one another or share very few dependencies. This option allows you to easily manage permissions for members on a per-project basis. You can also use LaunchDarkly [Teams](#using-teams) to manage access and permissions. One disadvantage to this method is that you can’t apply flags from one project to another project. You may also need to manage multiple SDK instances within the same project, and this adds complexity.
- **A single project for the entire organization:** If you have a smaller team, or are rolling out LaunchDarkly for only a specific project, you may not need to break it up into multiple projects. We do not recommend this approach if you have multiple teams, as your account can quickly become complex with multiple groups making thousands of flags in your environment.
- **Shared services with multiple projects:** In the shared services model, you have one project that refers to the product line and a second project that supports the shared service. You can initialize multiple instances of an SDK and write a wrapper around them to move the complexity away from your developers while still having features flags for all your services. However, this model can be complex to manage.

### Using teams

In addition to your broad organizational schema, you can further organize your LaunchDarkly account members using teams. Teams allow you to set up fine-grained access rules and assign this access to specific groups of people, giving them precise control over their feature flags, experiments, and projects. While you don’t need to define your teams and their permissions before you migrate, thinking about how you might like to organize your teams can help you decide which schema makes sense for your organization.

To learn more, read [Teams](/home/teams).

### Choosing a project or team to migrate first

If your engineering organization contains many teams, we recommend starting with a single team rather than trying to migrate all teams and their projects at once. You can focus your attention on helping one team rather than spreading it across many. Pick a team that won't be under pressure during the pilot. Teams starting a new project or teams with a maintenance period coming up between projects are good candidates. 

The team should be ready to provide regular feedback on its migration process, as well as assist in creating lightweight migration tools and documentation for the rest of the organization to use in their migrations.

## Migrating your flags

Once you've completed your preparations, it's time to start migrating your feature flags. Often customers will run their old and new systems in parallel. Your migration can take as long as you need. If you have a feature currently in the middle of a rollout, or you're running an experiment, leave those flags on the existing platform while you set up new flags in LaunchDarkly. It's fine to run systems in parallel for a couple of months while things wind down in your legacy system and your teams are trained. By implementing the migration slowly, you may be able to avoid giant cut-over steps and downtime.

To migrate your feature flags:

1. **Inform all engineering and other relevant teams of the plan**: Provide your teams with a rough outline and a scheduled timeline for each step.
2. **Choose the flags to migrate:** While preparing for the project, you identified your permanent and operations flags in your legacy system. Designate these for migration into LaunchDarkly.
3. **Create each new flag in LaunchDarkly:** Follow the flag naming convention you created during your planning phase. Ideally, you should be migrating few enough flags it is not burdensome to create them manually. You can use the LaunchDarkly API to preload all of your existing flags and targeting rules, but if you are migrating so many flags you need an automated process, you may not have thoroughly weeded your legacy flags.
4. **Compare flags between systems:** Look for mismatches between flags in your legacy system and LaunchDarkly. These may be flags that exist in both systems but have different targeting rules, or flags in the legacy system that you marked for migration but haven't migrated yet. You can do this manually or by using an external application performance management (APM) tool like New Relic One.
5. **Create an “evaluation mode” flag in LaunchDarkly:** This flag tells your application which system to consult for feature flags: your legacy system, LaunchDarkly, or both. You can leverage targeting rules for granular control between your environments and applications.
6. **Change the wrapper, not the calls:** Your legacy flag system may provide an API module. It likely contains flag evaluation functions that are called throughout the application code. Instead of changing all the application code that uses flags, change the implementation of the evaluation functions to use both the legacy system and LaunchDarkly. Internally, the new implementation evaluates flags by querying both the legacy system and LaunchDarkly and uses whichever flag it finds first. The order of querying is set by a dedicated “flag evaluation mode” flag, kept in LaunchDarkly. When the new wrapper is deployed, it should look to the legacy flag system first. Once the team is comfortable with LaunchDarkly, and the most important flags have been migrated, you can switch the flag evaluation mode to query LaunchDarkly first.
7. **Transition and test applications one at a time:** Prioritize transitioning the teams which own those applications, rather than the applications themselves. If the team fully understands the work to be done and the new practices to take on, they’ll work in sync with you rather than against you. Some customers use dual-writes so that any changes to feature flag states are automatically written to both LaunchDarkly and their legacy system. You can implement this in LaunchDarkly using webhooks. You can then perform periodic comparisons of specific applications as you migrate, or of all flag data, across both systems to ensure they remain consistent over time. To learn more, read [Webhooks](/home/connecting/webhooks).
8. **Stop creating new flags in your legacy system:** After you've maintained flags in both systems long enough to ensure things are working as expected, phase out your legacy system by creating new flags in LaunchDarkly only. This is the point of no return, as now the data between your legacy system and LaunchDarkly will diverge. You may want to enforce this by turning off the ability to create new flags in the legacy system, since it’s common for engineers to default to using it out of habit.
9. **Continue to monitor your flags:** Utilize your APM tool to identify any unexpected behavior going forward. When you're confident your flags are performing as expected, you can decommission your legacy system.

Congratulations! You have now successfully implemented LaunchDarkly.

## Planning for future use

As your organization begins using LaunchDarkly in earnest, you can begin integrating other third-party tools and thinking about how to manage technical debt.

### Integrating your tools

You likely use other third-party tools in your release process, such as applications like Slack, MS Teams, Jira, Azure DevOps, ServiceNow, AWS Kinesis, or Azure Events Hub. You can integrate these tools, and many others, with LaunchDarkly. For a full list of LaunchDarkly integrations and instructions on how to add them to your LaunchDarkly account, read [Integrations](/integrations).

### Preventing technical debt

Accumulating technical debt with feature flags is unavoidable, but there are steps you can take to minimize it. 

First, define what done means when it comes to a feature. When you create a flag, what processes do you have in place for ensuring the flag is removed? Is a feature done when it rolls out to 100% of users, or is it done when the flag is removed from the code? Coding a flag is a two-part process: creating a flag and removing a flag. You shouldn’t consider these two separate workflows. If you’re using Git to manage your work, we recommend submitting a pull request (PR) to remove the flag at the same time you submit the PR to add it.

To learn more about managing technical debt in LaunchDarkly, read [Reducing technical debt from feature flags](/guides/best-practices/technical-debt).

LaunchDarkly also provides code references to help you identify where in the codebase the feature flag is referenced for easier removal. To learn more, read [Code references](/home/code/code-references).
